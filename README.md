## What is RGB protocol?

RGB has appeared from the research by Peter Todd on single-use-seals and client-side-validation, which was coined in 2016-2019 by Giacomo Zucco and community into a better asset protocol for Bitcoin and Lightning network. Further evolution of these ideas led to a development of RGB into a fully-fledged smart contract system by Maxim Orlovsky, who is leading its implementation since 2019 with community participation.
 
RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin & lightning network. They embrace concepts of private & mutual ownership, abstraction and separation of concerns and represent "post-blockchain", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of "tokens".

RGB is not a token protocol. Though issuance and management of highly scalable, programmable and private assets of different sort is possible with RGB, it can be applied in many industries far beyond financial world.

As a smart contract system RGB is quite different from previous approaches, both Bitcoin-based (Colored coins, Counterparty, OMNI) and non-bitcoin (Ethereum, EOS and others):
RGB separates concept of smart contract issuer, state owners and state evolution
RGB keeps the smart contract code and data off-chain
RGB uses blockchain as a state commitment layer and Bitcoin script as an ownership control system; while smart contract evolution is defined by off-chain schema

### Potential Use Case

- Tokenized Securities
- Tokenized Real State
- Bitcoin as Collateral
- Decentralized Exchanges
- NFTs
- Stablecoins
- Decentralized identities
- Storage
- Lending
- Atomic Swap
- Submarine Swap
- Wallets
- Explorers
- Machine Learning
- Mint Services
- Social media (accepting payments via Stablecoins or tokens)
- DAOs
- Muti-layer network
- Multisig complex with Miniscript and more

## Tech Overview

Little overview around RGB 

### Core

- AluVM
- Encoding schema
- BP Core Lib
- Client-Side-Validation

### Design

In simple terms, RGB is a system that allows the user to audit a smart contract, execute it and verify it individually at any time without having an additional cost since for this it does not use a blockchain as "traditional" systems do, complex smart contracts systems were pioneered by Ethereum but due to it requires the user to spend significant amounts of gas for each operation, they never achieved the scalability they promised by consequence it never was an option to bank the users excluded from the current financial system.

Currently, the blockchain industry promotes that both the code of smart contracts and the data must be stored in the blockchain and executed by each node of the network, regardless of the excessive increase in size or the misuse of computational resources. The scheme proposed by RGB is much more intelligent and efficient since it cuts with the blockchain paradigm by having smart contracts and data separated from the blockchain and thus avoids the saturation of the network seen in other platforms, in turn it does not force each node to execute each contract but rather the parties involved which adds confidentiality to a level never seen before.

In RGB smart contract developer defines a scheme specifying rules how the contract evolves over time. The scheme is the standard for the construction of smart contracts in RGB, and both an issuer when defining a contract for issuance and a wallet or exchange must adhere to a particular scheme against which they must validate the contract. Only if the validation is correct can each party accept requests and work with the asset.

A smart contract in RGB is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of state changes, where only a portion of the graph is always known and there is no access to the rest. The RGB scheme is a core set of rules for the evolution of this graph the smart contract starts with. Each contract participant may add to those rules (if this is allowed by the schema) and the resulting graph is built from the iterative application of those rules.
